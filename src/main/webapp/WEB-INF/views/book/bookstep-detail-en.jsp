                    How Robin Hood Came to Be an Outlaw
                </div>
                <div id="contents-area">
                    IN MERRY ENGLAND in the time of old, when good King Henry the Second ruled the land, there lived
                    within the green glades of Sherwood Forest, near Nottingham Town, a famous outlaw whose name was
                    Robin Hood. No archer ever lived that could speed a gray goose shaft with such skill and cunning as
                    his, nor were there ever such yeomen as the sevenscore merry men that roamed with him through the
                    greenwood shades. Right merrily they dwelled within the depths of Sherwood Forest, suffering neither
                    care nor want, but passing the time in merry games of archery or bouts of cudgel play, living upon
                    the King's venison, washed down with draughts of ale of October brewing.
                    <p>
                    Not only Robin himself but all the band were outlaws and dwelled apart from other men, yet they were
                    beloved by the country people round about, for no one ever came to jolly Robin for help in time of
                    need and went away again with an empty fist.
                    <p>
                    And now I will tell how it came about that Robin Hood fell afoul of the law.
                    <p>
                    When Robin was a youth of eighteen, stout of sinew and bold of heart, the Sheriff of Nottingham
                    proclaimed a shooting match and offered a prize of a butt of ale to whosoever should shoot the best
                    shaft in Nottinghamshire. "Now," quoth Robin, "will I go too, for fain would I draw a string for the
                    bright eyes of my lass and a butt of good October brewing." So up he got and took his good stout yew
                    bow and a score or more of broad clothyard arrows, and started off from Locksley Town through
                    Sherwood Forest to Nottingham.
                    <p>
                    It was at the dawn of day in the merry Maytime, when hedgerows are green and flowers bedeck the
                    meadows; daisies pied and yellow cuckoo buds and fair primroses all along the briery hedges; when
                    apple buds blossom and sweet birds sing, the lark at dawn of day, the throstle cock and cuckoo; when
                    lads and lasses look upon each other with sweet thoughts; when busy housewives spread their linen to
                    bleach upon the bright green grass. Sweet was the greenwood as he walked along its paths, and bright
                    the green and rustling leaves, amid which the little birds sang with might and main: and blithely
                    Robin whistled as he trudged along, thinking of Maid Marian and her bright eyes, for at such times a
                    youth's thoughts are wont to turn pleasantly upon the lass that he loves the best.
                    <p>
                    As thus he walked along with a brisk step and a merry whistle, he came suddenly upon some foresters
                    seated beneath a great oak tree. Fifteen there were in all, making themselves merry with feasting
                    and drinking as they sat around a huge pasty, to which each man helped himself, thrusting his hands
                    into the pie, and washing down that which they ate with great horns of ale which they drew all
                    foaming from a barrel that stood nigh. Each man was clad in Lincoln green, and a fine show they
                    made, seated upon the sward beneath that fair, spreading tree. Then one of them, with his mouth
                    full, called out to Robin, "Hulloa, where goest thou, little lad, with thy one-penny bow and thy
                    farthing shafts?"
                    <p>
                    Then Robin grew angry, for no stripling likes to be taunted with his green years.
                    <p>
                    "Now," quoth he, "my bow and eke mine arrows are as good as shine; and moreover, I go to the
                    shooting match at Nottingham Town, which same has been proclaimed by our good Sheriff of
                    Nottinghamshire; there I will shoot with other stout yeomen, for a prize has been offered of a fine
                    butt of ale."
                    <p>
                    Then one who held a horn of ale in his hand said, "Ho! listen to the lad! Why, boy, thy mother's
                    milk is yet scarce dry upon thy lips, and yet thou pratest of standing up with good stout men at
                    Nottingham butts, thou who art scarce able to draw one string of a two-stone bow."
                    <p>
                    "I'll hold the best of you twenty marks," quoth bold Robin, "that I hit the clout at threescore
                    rods, by the good help of Our Lady fair."
                    <p>
                    At this all laughed aloud, and one said, "Well boasted, thou fair infant, well boasted! And well
                    thou knowest that no target is nigh to make good thy wager."
                    <p>
                    And another cried, "He will be taking ale with his milk next."
                    <p>
                    At this Robin grew right mad. "Hark ye," said he, "yonder, at the glade's end, I see a herd of deer,
                    even more than threescore rods distant. I'll hold you twenty marks that, by leave of Our Lady, I
                    cause the best hart among them to die."
                    <p>
                    "Now done!" cried he who had spoken first. "And here are twenty marks. I wager that thou causest no
                    beast to die, with or without the aid of Our Lady."
                    <p>
                    Then Robin took his good yew bow in his hand, and placing the tip at his instep, he strung it right
                    deftly; then he nocked a broad clothyard arrow and, raising the bow, drew the gray goose feather to
                    his ear; the next moment the bowstring rang and the arrow sped down the glade as a sparrowhawk skims
                    in a northern wind. High leaped the noblest hart of all the herd, only to fall dead, reddening the
                    green path with his heart's blood.
                    <p>
                    "Ha!" cried Robin, "how likest thou that shot, good fellow? I wot the wager were mine, an it were
                    three hundred pounds."
                    <p>
                    Then all the foresters were filled with rage, and he who had spoken the first and had lost the wager
                    was more angry than all.
                    <p>
                    "Nay," cried he, "the wager is none of thine, and get thee gone, straightway, or, by all the saints
                    of heaven, I'll baste thy sides until thou wilt ne'er be able to walk again." "Knowest thou not,"
                    said another, "that thou hast killed the King's deer, and, by the laws of our gracious lord and
                    sovereign King Harry, thine ears should be shaven close to thy head?"
                    <p>
                    "Catch him!" cried a third.
                    <p>
                    "Nay," said a fourth, "let him e'en go because of his tender years."
                    <p>
                    Never a word said Robin Hood, but he looked at the foresters with a grim face; then, turning on his
                    heel, strode away from them down the forest glade. But his heart was bitterly angry, for his blood
                    was hot and youthful and prone to boil.
                    <p>
                    Now, well would it have been for him who had first spoken had he left Robin Hood alone; but his
                    anger was hot, both because the youth had gotten the better of him and because of the deep draughts
                    of ale that he had been quaffing. So, of a sudden, without any warning, he sprang to his feet, and
                    seized upon his bow and fitted it to a shaft. "Ay," cried he, "and I'll hurry thee anon." And he
                    sent the arrow whistling after Robin.
                    <p>
                    It was well for Robin Hood that that same forester's head was spinning with ale, or else he would
                    never have taken another step. As it was, the arrow whistled within three inches of his head. Then
                    he turned around and quickly drew his own bow, and sent an arrow back in return.
                    <p>
                    "Ye said I was no archer," cried he aloud, "but say so now again!"
                    <p>
                    The shaft flew straight; the archer fell forward with a cry, and lay on his face upon the ground,
                    his arrows rattling about him from out of his quiver, the gray goose shaft wet with his; heart's
                    blood. Then, before the others could gather their wits about them, Robin Hood was gone into the
                    depths of the greenwood. Some started after him, but not with much heart, for each feared to suffer
                    the death of his fellow; so presently they all came and lifted the dead man up and bore him away to
                    Nottingham Town.
                    <p>
                    Meanwhile Robin Hood ran through the greenwood. Gone was all the joy and brightness from everything,
                    for his heart was sick within him, and it was borne in upon his soul that he had slain a man.
